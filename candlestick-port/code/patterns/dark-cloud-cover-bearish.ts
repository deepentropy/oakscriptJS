    'Dark Cloud Cover\nDark Cloud Cover is a two-candle bearish reversal candlestick pattern found in an uptrend. The first candle is green and has a larger than average body. The second candle is red and opens above the high of the prior candle, creating a gap, and then closes below the midpoint of the first candle. The pattern shows a possible shift in the momentum from the upside to the downside, indicating that a reversal might happen soon.',
