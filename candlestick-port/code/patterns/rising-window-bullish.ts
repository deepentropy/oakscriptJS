    "Rising Window\nRising Window is a two-candle bullish continuation pattern that forms during an uptrend. Both candles in the pattern can be of any type with the exception of the Four-Price Doji. The most important characteristic of the pattern is a price gap between the first candle's high and the second candle's low. That gap (window) between two bars signifies support against the selling pressure.",
