    'Falling Window\nFalling Window is a two-candle bearish continuation pattern that forms during a downtrend. Both candles in the pattern can be of any type, with the exception of the Four-Price Doji. The most important characteristic of the pattern is a price gap between the first candle\'s low and the second candle\'s high. The existence of this gap (window) means that the bearish trend is expected to continue.',
